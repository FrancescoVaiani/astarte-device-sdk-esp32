# Astarte ESP32 SDK

Astarte ESP32 SDK lets you connect your ESP32 device to Astarte.

This is currently a technology preview and its API could (and probably will) change.

## Documentation

More detailed documentation is on its way, meanwhile you can have a look at `astarte_device.h`,
that exposes the high level SDK API. In the `examples` folder you can also find a working example.
